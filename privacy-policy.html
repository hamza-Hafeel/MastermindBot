            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how MastermindBot collects, uses, and protects your data when you interact with the bot on Telegram.

            <h2>Data Collection in Groups</h2>
            <p>
                When MastermindBot is added to a group, it collects and stores the following information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The group's title and unique ChatID provided by Telegram.</li>
                <li>The date of the last message sent in the group.</li>
                <li>A list of members who have interacted with the bot by sending at least one message in the group.</li>
                <li>Settings applied by group administrators using the <code>/settings</code> command.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All data is associated with the group's ChatID and is used solely for the bot's functionality.
            </p>

            <h2>User Interaction</h2>
            <p>
                When you interact with MastermindBot in a group or private chat, the bot collects and updates the following information:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>The date of your last interaction with the bot.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This data is associated with your unique UserID provided by Telegram and is used to enhance your experience with the bot.

            <h2>Secondary Information</h2>
            <p>
                MastermindBot does not store secondary information such as profile pictures or admin lists. These details are retrieved in real-time from Telegram's servers when needed (e.g., when you use the <code>/profile</code> command).

            <h2>Bot Administrators Access</h2>
            <p>
                The bot's founders and administrators have access to logs for maintenance and support purposes. However, access is limited to essential logs, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creation of new bot instances.</li>
                <li>Requests to reset group or user data.</li>
                <li>Donation-related activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Administrators may also access the last 200 messages from a user or group if the user or group is blocked for violating the bot's rules. This access is strictly limited to resolving appeals or disputes.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Game Image Generation</h2>
            <p>
                MastermindBot generates game images dynamically on its own servers. No information related to these images is shared with external services, ensuring your privacy is protected.
